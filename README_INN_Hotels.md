# üè® INN Hotels ‚Äî Booking Cancellation Prediction (Low-Code ML Project)

A machine learning solution designed to help INN Hotels Group predict potential booking cancellations before they happen. This project applies predictive analytics to optimize room management, reduce last-minute revenue loss, and improve hotel operations using a **low-code** ML approach.

---

## üéØ Project Objective

> INN Hotels Group ‚Äî a hotel chain in Portugal ‚Äî is facing significant losses due to last-minute booking cancellations. This project leverages machine learning to predict which bookings are likely to be canceled, giving the hotel time to mitigate revenue loss and optimize guest management.

## üìä Business Impact of Cancellations

- Lost revenue from unoccupied rooms
- Increased distribution costs due to re-marketing efforts
- Lower profit margins from last-minute price drops
- Higher operational strain on staff and planning teams

---

## üß† ML Solution Highlights

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key cancellation drivers
- Preprocessing of categorical and numeric variables
- Model training using low-code tools (e.g., PyCaret, AutoML frameworks)
- Evaluation using precision, recall, AUC, and confusion matrix
- Deployment-ready logic for integration with booking systems
